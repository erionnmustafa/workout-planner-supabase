AI LOG — Workout Planner (Expo + Supabase)

Goal:
Build a mobile workout planner with authentication as a main criterion and extend it into a full-featured app suitable for presentation: CRUD workouts, media, analytics, achievements, and reminders.

Implemented:
- Supabase Auth: sign up, sign in, persistent session.
- Supabase Tables:
  - profiles (user_id, full_name, avatar_url)
  - user_settings (goal, level, weekly_target, reminders_enabled, reminder_time, points)
  - workouts (name, plan jsonb, image_url, video_url, user_id)
  - workout_completions (user_id, workout_id, completed_at)
- RLS Policies:
  - Users can only read/write their own rows for profiles, settings, workouts, completions.
- Storage:
  - avatars bucket (public)
  - workout-images bucket (public)
- App UX:
  - Premium UI style (glass cards + gradient background)
  - Dashboard with analytics and clickable navigation
  - Workouts with add/edit/delete, image upload, YouTube playback, completion action
  - Achievements system (client-calculated)
  - Points (rewards) awarded per completion
  - Daily reminders via expo-notifications

Dependencies added:
- react-native-url-polyfill
- expo-notifications

Testing notes:
- Verify buckets exist and are public.
- Ensure SQL was executed successfully.
- Use “Complete” button to generate workout_completions.
- Points should increase by 10 per completion.
- Streak is computed based on completion days.
- Weekly progress counts completions since start of the week.

Placement:
- README.md -> project root
- AI_LOG.txt -> project root
