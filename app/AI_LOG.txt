AI LOG — Workout Planner Mobile App

This project was developed with assistance from AI tools (ChatGPT) to improve:
- Code structure
- Feature completeness
- User experience
- Debugging and error handling
- Database design decisions

How AI was used:

1. **Planning**
   - Breaking down project requirements into achievable steps
   - Designing feature roadmap (Auth → Workouts → History → Dashboard)

2. **Development Support**
   - Help with Supabase Auth integration
   - Guidance on database tables and Row Level Security (RLS)
   - Assistance with React Native state management
   - UI/UX suggestions inspired by real fitness apps

3. **Debugging**
   - Resolving Expo dependency issues
   - Fixing authentication edge cases
   - Handling incorrect user inputs gracefully

4. **Feature Enhancement**
   - Workout history with logs
   - Achievement system based on user activity
   - Streak calculation logic
   - Rest timer logic
   - Search and filtering logic

5. **Documentation**
   - Writing README documentation
   - Structuring the project for presentation and grading

Final Result:
A fully functional, advanced mobile fitness application with:
- Authentication
- Database-backed workouts
- History tracking
- Analytics dashboard
- Achievements
- Timer functionality

The AI was used as a development assistant, not as an automatic code generator.
All logic was reviewed and understood during implementation.
